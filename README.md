# Transparent Background
This mod removes stupid blue blending of background image and shitty yellow list background in several menu pages and let us able to enjoy the raw anime background we pick.
In addition, you can customize loading circle colors to fix your background theme.
Also you can switch to dark theme for gauntlet/daily/weekly levels.

Will consider customizing the background color by your own or something else.

So this is my first mod and the initial motivation I learn geode modding,~~ idk why Absolute aren't gonna port Transparent BG to MH8 until Feb 2024 anyway.~~
